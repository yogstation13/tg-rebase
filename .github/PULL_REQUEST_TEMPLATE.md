# Github documenting your Pull Request

Remove this text and explain what the purpose of your PR is.

Mention if you have tested your changes. If you changed a map, make sure you used the mapmerge tool.
If this is an Issue Correction, you can type "Fixes Issue #6" to link the PR to the corresponding Issue number #6.

Prefix the PR title with [admin] if it involves something admin related. 
Prefix the PR title with [s] if you are fixing an exploit, so that it is not announced on the Yogstation Discord and the server.

Remember: something that is self-evident to you might not be to others. Explain your rationale fully, even if you feel it goes without saying.
